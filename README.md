# Browser RPG

Not much work put into this yet - messing around with the idea of making a single-player largely-random text-based game in the browser. Influences include Dwarf Fortress and Baldur's Gate.

Currently has basic world generation following TypeScript record rules, and a useContext and useReducer to manage the gameState.
